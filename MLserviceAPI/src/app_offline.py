        'Beans, beans, the magical fruit, Healthy, tasty, And useful, to boot! Save that canned water, And whip it to foam, It’s an   replacement, Made right at home! OK, so it’s not the playground rhyme you grew up with. But with the avid following that canned bean water  —   more appetizingly known as ”aquafaba”  —   has gained in just a few short years, maybe it’s time that rhyme got rewritten. Aquafaba is commonly made from chickpea water, though some people have used soy or   beans like cannellini as a base. Whipped into a stiff foam, it’s an excellent replacement for egg whites  —   and a cause for rejoicing among vegans. The name aquafaba (loosely, a combination of the Latin words aqua, for water, and faba, for beans) comes courtesy of Goose Wohlt, a software engineer and vegan who stumbled across the magic ingredient in 2015, while looking for a way to make   meringues for his mother’s Seder. To crowdsource the process, Wohlt started working with a vegan Facebook group. Today, that group has more than 68, 000 members, who post recipes and photos of dishes made with aquafaba, and the occasional ”What am I doing wrong?” question. After two years of rallying from the vegan community and others experimenting with ”eggless” egg whites, these DIY recipes are now getting codified into cookbooks devoted solely to the pulse miracle that is aquafaba. In October 2016, vegan cookbook author and blogger Zsu Dever released the first of these books: Aquafaba. This month, vegan blogger Rebecca Coleman’s Aquafabulous will also become available. ”The fact that we can take this liquid from beans and make it into a whole slew of delectable dishes is just incredible,” Dever told NPR. Egg whites are a culinary workhorse that omnivores frequently take for granted. Without them there are no   cocktails, no meringues, no mousses, macarons, or angel food cakes  —   just to name a few. So the discovery of aquafaba has been like ”an explosion in the vegan community,” Dever writes. In Aquafaba, Dever puts the    ingredient through its paces, providing a variety of sweet and savory recipes, including vegan butter, cream cheese, doughnuts, challah and brioche breads and more. Testing these recipes using aquafaba was no small task. Dever says there was a lot of experimentation: In total, she used 100 pounds of sugar and 150 pounds of chickpeas to test all of the recipes in her book. ”This wasn’t something where [the recipes] just needed to taste good and look good,” Dever says. ”They needed to actually work  —   and not just in my kitchen.” While making meringue, Dever discovered, aquafaba would refuse to whip if there was any oil in the bowl. If the mix was too diluted, Dever says, the meringue would deflate. Coleman’s Aquafabulous cookbook puts the ingredient to use in vegan coconut bacon, scrambled ”eggs,” vegan burgers, hummus and other dips. (Coleman says aquafaba makes them ”even creamier. ”) But what is it about bean water that makes it such a multifaceted addition to the kitchen? Though Wohlt crowdfunded some nutritional information on aquafaba, his website devoted to the ingredient is clear about the fact that there’s still very little understanding of its chemistry. ”Aquafaba is unique among egg replacers in that it captures some but not all of the characteristics of both egg white and yolk,” he writes. ”It can be used as a thickener, binder, emulsifier, foaming agent, and more.” Likely because aquafaba is still very much a grassroots product (I have yet to see jars of aquafaba sans beans sold in grocery stores, though surely it’s only a matter of time) there’s been little reason for companies to analyze how it works. So far, only Sir Kensington’s condiments appears to have made a big brand commercial food from aquafaba: a   mayonnaise called Fabanaise that went to market in early 2016. Chefs have been quicker to experiment with aquafaba. Dan Barber’s Blue Hill restaurant in New York City used chickpea water in its 2015 wastED popup, which made dishes out of ingredients that usually go to waste. Bartenders have put a vegan spin on foamy cocktails like gin fizzes or pisco sours by substituting aquafaba for egg whites. In other words, beans are growing up. Rather than being the butt of flatulence jokes, bean water is written about almost reverently on cooking blogs. For vegan cooks, its existence is nothing less than a miracle. Even lexicographers love the rebranding of leftover bean water. In recent months, ”aquafaba” has been added to the Oxford Dictionaries database. ”As language nerds we were quite pleased by that because it is a compound of Latin words and sounds very nice,” Angus Stevenson, Oxford Dictionaries’ head of content development, told The Guardian. Tove Danovich is a writer based in Portland, Ore.',

Despite new attempts to overhaul Windows upgrades, the platform continues to anger users with poor quality updates and questionable transparency. And now Microsoft has had to issue another major warning to all Windows 10 users. Pushed to users as part of its latest ‘Patch Tuesday’ updates, Microsoft has confirmed the KB4524244 security update bundled in it can cause system freezes and crashes across every supported version of Windows 10, from Windows 10 Home right through to Enterprise and Server. Unfortunately, KB4524244 was available for four days but Microsoft has now stated it has been pulled for good. “This standalone security update has been removed and will not [be] re-offered from Windows Update, Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) or Microsoft Update Catalog,” wrote the company on the Windows 10 Health Dashboard. While Microsoft has now stopped the spread, users already impacted are left to pick up the pieces. As Bleeping Computer reported earlier in the week, both AMD and Intel computers were affected with HP owners hit particularly hard. Microsoft says it is “working on an improved version of this update” but in the meantime, it recommends affected users remove KB4524244 with these steps: In Windows Desktop Search type ‘update history’ then click ‘View your Update history’ Select ‘Uninstall Updates’ On the Installed Updates dialog window, find and select KB4524244, click the Uninstall button Restart Proactive users can also download the Windows Update troubleshooter, which will allow you to hide problematic updates and prevent them from reinstalling.

        'When Walt Disney’s “Bambi” opened in 1942, critics praised its spare, haunting visual style, vastly different from anything Disney had done before. But what they did not know was that the film’s striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist, who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to “Bambi,” which remains a   mark for film animation, would not be widely known for decades. Like the film’s title character, the artist, Tyrus Wong, weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  —   and, in the hope of making a life in America, incarceration, isolation and rigorous interrogation  —   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed, he endured poverty, discrimination and chronic lack of recognition, not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art, before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106. A Hollywood studio artist, painter, printmaker, calligrapher,   illustrator and, in later years, maker of fantastical kites, he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject, he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition, when Mr. Wong did find it, was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation, professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter, Mr. Wong was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in California between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934, his work was included in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago that also featured Picasso, Matisse and Paul Klee. As a staff artist for Hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s, he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings, as detailed as any architectural illustrations, that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for Disney and   films for Warner Brothers and other studios, among them “The Sands of Iwo Jima” (1949) “Rebel Without a Cause” (1955) and “The Wild Bunch” (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked, it was for “Bambi” that Mr. Wong was  —   belatedly  —   most renowned. “He was truly involved with every phase of production,” John Canemaker, an   animator and a historian of animation at New York University, said in an interview for this obituary in March. “He created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. ” In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Wong was the subject of “Water to Paper, Paint to Sky,” a major retrospective at the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. From the museum’s windows, which overlook San Francisco Bay, he could contemplate Angel Island, where more than nine decades earlier, as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. Wong Gen Yeo (the name is sometimes Romanized Wong Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25, 1910, in a farming village in Guangdong Province. As a young child, he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920, seeking better economic prospects, Gen Yeo and his father embarked for the United States, leaving his mother and sister behind. Gen Yeo would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  —   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a “paper son”  —   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, the act, which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country, was among the earliest United States laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906, an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents, including birth and immigration records, were destroyed, many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss, maintaining that they had been born in San Francisco before the fire. As United States citizens, they were entitled to bring over their relatives  —   or, in the case of Gen Yeo and his father, “paper sons” posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception, United States immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately, and the answers had to match. For the new arrival, a major mistake, or a series of smaller ones, could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing, aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    Gen Yeo would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30, 1920, after a month at sea, the Wongs landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. Wong was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as Look Tai Yow. “Angel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast,” Lisa See, the author of “On Gold Mountain” (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family, said in an interview in 2016. However, she continued: “The goal was really very different than Ellis Island, which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. ” Because Mr. Wong’s father had previously lived in the United States as Look Get, he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival, Gen Yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month, the only child among the immigrants being held there. “I was scared half to death I just cried,” Mr. Wong recalled in “Tyrus,” an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom, which premiered in 2015. “Every day is just miserable  —   miserable. I hated that place. ” On Jan. 27, 1921, in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer, young Gen Yeo, posing as Look Tai Yow, was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error. In Sacramento, where he joined his father, a schoolteacher Americanized “Tai Yow” to “Tyrus,” and he was known as Tyrus Wong ever after. Soon afterward, father and son were separated once more, when the elder Mr. Wong moved to Los Angeles to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time, he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a Sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  —   possibly more  —   Tyrus traveled to Los Angeles to join his father, who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school, Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families, earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father, who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high, a teacher, noting his drawing talent, arranged a summer scholarship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. By his own account an indifferent student in public school, Tyrus found his calling at the institute, now the Otis College of Art and Design. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  —   a small fortune  —   to let him stay on as Otis’s youngest student. He studied there for at least five years, simultaneously working as the school janitor, before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died, leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938, Mr. Wong was an artist for the Works Progress Administration, creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends, including the   artist Benji Okubo, he founded the Oriental Artists’ Group of Los Angeles, which organized exhibitions of members’ work  —   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. Wong, newly married and needing steady work, joined Disney in 1938 as an “” creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at Hollywood studios, and Mr. Wong was made keenly aware of the fact, first at Disney and later at Warner Brothers. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  ’s job itself: Painstaking, repetitive and for Mr. Wong quickly   it is the   work of animation  —   “a terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter,” Mr. Canemaker said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s, when Mr. Wong learned that Disney was adapting “Bambi, a Life in the Woods,” the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer Felix Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book, Disney had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  —   every petal on every flower, every leaf on every tree  —   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for “Bambi,” it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. Wong spied his chance. “I said, ‘Gee, this is all outdoor scenery,’” he recalled in a video interview years afterward, adding: “I said, ‘Gee, I’m a landscape painter! ’” Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A. D. 960 —  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody, lyrical and atmospheric  —   at once lush and spare  —   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. “Walt Disney went crazy over them,” said Mr. Canemaker, who wrote about Mr. Wong in his book “Before the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists” (1996). “He said, ‘I love this indefinite quality, the mysterious quality of the forest. ’” Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. “But he was more than that,” Mr. Canemaker explained. “He was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color, about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings, he inspired people. ” Mr. Wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of “Bambi. ” Throughout the finished film  —   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty, desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  —   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941, in the wake of a bitter employees’ strike that year, Disney fired Mr. Wong. Though he had chosen not to strike  —   he felt the studio had been good to him, Mr. Canemaker said  —   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On “Bambi,” Mr. Wong’s name appears, quite far down in the credits, as a mere “background” artist. Mr. Wong joined Warner Brothers in 1942, working there  —   and lent out on occasion to other studios  —   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house, he and his wife, the former Ruth Kim, were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. “Then in a month you’d go back there and the sign was still there,” Mr. Wong recalled in “Tyrus. ” After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Mr. Wong, like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage, lest an angry American beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling Oriental Artists’ Group. Mr. Wong’s friend Mr. Okubo was sent, with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. “If World War II hadn’t happened when it did, I think these artists, even the   artists, would have more of a name than they do today,” Ms. See said. “And that’s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. ” Mr. Wong, who became a United States citizen in 1946, also designed Christmas cards for Hallmark and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware, now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of Sunland, Calif. he became, in retirement, a renowned kitemaker, designing, building and hand coloring astonishing, airworthy creations  —   butterflies, swallows, whole flocks of owls, centipedes more than 100 feet long  —   that streaked the Southern California sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth Wong’s life, when she was ill with dementia, Mr. Wong forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995, he slowly began making art again. In 2001, in formal recognition of his influence on “Bambi,” Mr. Wong was named a Disney Legend. The honor  —   whose previous recipients include Fred MacMurray, Julie Andrews and Annette Funicello  —   is bestowed by the Walt Disney Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, curated in part by Ms. See, was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. The Disney Family Museum’s retrospective, “Water to Paper, Paint to Sky,” traveled in 2015 to the Museum of Chinese in America, in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Wong’s death, at his home in Sunland, was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. Tom. His survivors include three daughters, Kay Fong,   Wong and Kim Wong and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small, Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art, as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained, he said, by lines laid down by others.',
        'Death may be the great equalizer, but it isn’t necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016  —   consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the      Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds  —   the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona  —   androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist  —   was as   as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his  —   I hesitate to say merry  —   way, ever the wise,   troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, “Until then, here’s another song. ” It was as if 2016 hadn’t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another   death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people can’t bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer Glenn Frey of the Eagles and Maurice White of Earth, Wind  Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man’s mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the   outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis’s swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose   genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking   and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golf’s first media star. The gentleman’s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of   postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome  —   but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88 and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductor’s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake  —   his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant  —   can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated women’s basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat Alzheimer’s disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N. B. A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86 his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a   Hall of Fame career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the   major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball’s first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy Reagan’s death evoked the 1980s White House, where   glamour and   West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn’s had us thinking again about a   burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War’s roiling home front. Phyllis Schlafly’s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing’s ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex. to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Elián González, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel Castro’s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a   strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros   the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are   even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and,   Edward Albee  —   all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun   for our viewing pleasure  —   none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the     Princess Leia of the “Star Wars” tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother’s grief. Devotees of the “Harry Potter” movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snape’s younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor’s celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a   culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the “Godfather” movies and “Barney Miller,” actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his   meditations on life and art Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics’ eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (“Adventures of Superman”) Alan Young (“Mister Ed”) Robert Vaughn (“The Man From U. N. C. L. E. ”) William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on “The Patty Duke Show”) Dan Haggerty (“The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams”) Florence Henderson (“The Brady Bunch”) and Alan Thicke (“Growing Pains”). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with “Happy Days,” “Mork  Mindy,” “Laverne  Shirley” and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker’s jacket with a camera slung around his neck  —   what a picture!  —   had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music’s other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a   executive, Grant Tinker, who in the ’80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a   gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone’s guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.',
        'Danny Cahill stood, slightly dazed, in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage. He had won Season 8 of NBC’s reality television show “The Biggest Loser,” shedding more weight than anyone ever had on the program  —   an astonishing 239 pounds in seven months. When he got on the scale for all to see that evening, Dec. 8, 2009, he weighed just 191 pounds, down from 430. Dressed in a   and   shorts, he was lean, athletic and as handsome as a model. “I’ve got my life back,” he declared. “I mean, I feel like a million bucks. ” Mr. Cahill left the show’s stage in Hollywood and flew directly to New York to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows, chatting with Jay Leno, Regis Philbin and Joy Behar. As he heard from fans all over the world, his elation knew no bounds. But in the years since, more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his    frame despite his best efforts. In fact, most of that season’s 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously. Some are even heavier now. Yet their experiences, while a bitter personal disappointment, have been a gift to science. A study of Season 8’s contestants has yielded surprising new discoveries about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight they lose. Kevin Hall, a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality TV, had the idea to follow the “Biggest Loser” contestants for six years after that victorious night. The project was the first to measure what happened to people over as long as six years after they had lost large amounts of weight with intensive dieting and exercise. The results, the researchers said, were stunning. They showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss. “It is frightening and amazing,” said Dr. Hall, an expert on metabolism at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. “I am just blown away. ” It has to do with resting metabolism, which determines how many calories a person burns when at rest. When the show began, the contestants, though hugely overweight, had normal metabolisms for their size, meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for people of their weight. When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes. Researchers knew that just about anyone who deliberately loses weight  —   even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight  —   will have a slower metabolism when the diet ends. So they were not surprised to see that “The Biggest Loser” contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended. What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestants’ metabolisms did not recover. They became even slower, and the pounds kept piling on. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight. Mr. Cahill was one of the worst off. As he regained more than 100 pounds, his metabolism slowed so much that, just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds, he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size. Anything more turns to fat. The struggles the contestants went through help explain why it has been so hard to make headway against the nation’s obesity problem, which afflicts more than a third of American adults. Despite spending billions of dollars on   drugs and dieting programs, even the most motivated are working against their own biology. Their experience shows that the body will fight back for years. And that, said Dr. Michael Schwartz, an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, is “new and important. ” “The key point is that you can be on TV, you can lose enormous amounts of weight, you can go on for six years, but you can’t get away from a basic biological reality,” said Dr. Schwartz, who was not involved in the study. “As long as you are below your initial weight, your body is going to try to get you back. ” The show’s doctor, Robert Huizenga, says he expected the contestants’ metabolic rates to fall just after the show, but was hoping for a smaller drop. He questioned, though, whether the measurements six years later were accurate. But maintaining weight loss is difficult, he said, which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off. “Unfortunately, many contestants are unable to find or afford adequate ongoing support with exercise doctors, psychologists, sleep specialists, and trainers  —   and that’s something we all need to work hard to change,” he said in an email. The study’s findings, to be published on Monday in the journal Obesity, are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity. Researchers are figuring out why being fat makes so many people develop diabetes and other medical conditions, and they are searching for new ways to block the poison in fat. They are starting to unravel the reasons bariatric surgery allows most people to lose significant amounts of weight when dieting so often fails. And they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people. The hope is that this work will eventually lead to new therapies that treat obesity as a chronic disease and can help keep weight under control for life. Most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off, but many blame themselves when the pounds come back. But what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies, which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights, whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off. There is always a weight a person’s body maintains without any effort. And while it is not known why that weight can change over the years  —   it may be an effect of aging  —   at any point, there is a weight that is easy to maintain, and that is the weight the body fights to defend. Finding a way to thwart these mechanisms is the goal scientists are striving for. First, though, they are trying to understand them in greater detail. Dr. David Ludwig, the director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children’s Hospital, who was not involved in the research, said the findings showed the need for new approaches to weight control. He cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight. But, he added, the findings made sense. “This is a subset of the most successful” dieters, he said. “If they don’t show a return to normal in metabolism, what hope is there for the rest of us?” Still, he added, “that shouldn’t be interpreted to mean we are doomed to battle our biology or remain fat. It means we need to explore other approaches. ” Some scientists say weight maintenance has to be treated as an issue separate from weight loss. Only when that challenge is solved, they say, can progress truly be made against obesity. “There is a lot of basic research we still need to do,” said Dr. Margaret Jackson, who is directing a project at Pfizer. Her group is testing a drug that, in animals at least, acts like leptin, a hormone that controls hunger. With weight loss, leptin levels fall and people become hungry. The idea is to trick the brains of people who have lost weight so they do not become ravenous for lack of leptin. While many of the contestants kept enough weight off to improve their health and became more physically active, the low weights they strived to keep eluded all but one of them: Erinn Egbert, a   caregiver for her mother in Versailles, Ky. And she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size. “What people don’t understand is that a treat is like a drug,” said Ms. Egbert, who went from 263 pounds to just under 176 on the show, and now weighs between 152 and 157. “Two treats can turn into a binge over a   period. That is what I struggle with. ” Six years after Season 8 ended, 14 of the 16 contestants went to the N. I. H. last fall for three days of testing. The researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose weight before coming in, so they shipped equipment to them that would measure their physical activity and weight before their visit, and had the information sent remotely to the N. I. H. The contestants received their metabolic results last week. They were shocked, but on further reflection, decided the numbers explained a lot. “All my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight,” Mr. Cahill said. “The moment I started drinking beer, there goes another 20 pounds. I said, ‘This is not right. Something is wrong with my body. ’” Sean Algaier, 36, a pastor from Charlotte, N. C. feels cheated. He went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show. Now his weight is up to 450 again, and he is burning 458 fewer calories a day than would be expected for a man his size. “It’s kind of like hearing you have a life sentence,” he said. Slower metabolisms were not the only reason the contestants regained weight, though. They constantly battled hunger, cravings and binges. The investigators found at least one reason: plummeting levels of leptin. The contestants started out with normal levels of leptin. By the season’s finale, they had almost no leptin at all, which would have made them ravenous all the time. As their weight returned, their leptin levels drifted up again, but only to about half of what they had been when the season began, the researchers found, thus helping to explain their urges to eat. Leptin is just one of a cluster of hormones that control hunger, and although Dr. Hall and his colleagues did not measure the rest of them, another group of researchers, in a different project, did. In a   study funded by Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council, Dr. Joseph Proietto of the University of Melbourne and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks. They lost an average of nearly 30 pounds, but over the next year, the pounds started coming back. Dr. Proietto and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people. Levels of most of them fell in their study subjects. They also looked at a hormone that makes people want to eat. Its level rose. “What was surprising was what a coordinated effect it is,” Dr. Proietto said. “The body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight. The only way to maintain weight loss is to be hungry all the time. We desperately need agents that will suppress hunger and that are safe with   use. ” Mr. Cahill, 46, said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade. He got fat, then fatter. He would starve himself, and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon. Afterward, he would cower in the pantry off the kitchen, feeling overwhelmed with shame. Over the years, his insatiable urge to eat kept overcoming him, and his weight climbed: 370 pounds, 400, 460, 485. “I used to look at myself and think, ‘I am horrible, I am a monster, subhuman,’” he said. He began sleeping in a recliner because he was too heavy to sleep lying down. Walking hurt stairs were agony. Buying clothes with a 68 waist was humiliating. “I remember sitting in a dressing room one day, and nothing would fit. I looked at the traffic outside on the street and thought, ‘I should just run out in front of a car. ’” He eventually seized on “The Biggest Loser” as his best chance to lose enough weight to live a normal life. He tried three times and was finally selected. Before the show began, the contestants underwent medical tests to be sure they could endure the rigorous schedule that lay ahead. And rigorous it was. Sequestered on the “Biggest Loser” ranch with the other contestants, Mr. Cahill exercised seven hours a day, burning 8, 000 to 9, 000 calories according to a calorie tracker the show gave him. He took electrolyte tablets to help replace the salts he lost through sweating, consuming many fewer calories than before. Eventually, he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own. Mr. Cahill set a goal of a   deficit per day. The idea was to lose a pound a day. He quit his job as a land surveyor to do it. His routine went like this: Wake up at 5 a. m. and run on a treadmill for 45 minutes. Have breakfast  —   typically one egg and two egg whites, half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast. Run on the treadmill for another 45 minutes. Rest for 40 minutes bike ride nine miles to a gym. Work out for two and a half hours. Shower, ride home, eat lunch  —   typically a grilled skinless chicken breast, a cup of broccoli and 10 spears of asparagus. Rest for an hour. Drive to the gym for another round of exercise. If he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal, he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more. At times, he found himself running around his neighborhood in the dark until his   indicator reset to zero at midnight. On the day of the   on the show’s finale, Mr. Cahill and the others dressed carefully to hide the rolls of loose skin that remained, to their surprise and horror, after they had lost weight. They wore compression undergarments to hold it in. Mr. Cahill knew he could not maintain his finale weight of 191 pounds. He was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended. But he had started a new career giving motivational speeches as the biggest loser ever, and for the next four years, he managed to keep his weight below 255 pounds by exercising two to three hours a day. But two years ago, he went back to his job as a surveyor, and the pounds started coming back. Soon the scale hit 265. Mr. Cahill started weighing and measuring his food again and stepped up his exercise. He got back down to 235 to 240 pounds. But his weight edged up again, to 275, then 295. His slow metabolism is part of the problem, and so are his food cravings. He opens a bag of chips, thinking he will have just a few. “I’d eat five bites. Then I’d black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say, ‘What did I do? ’” Dr. Lee Kaplan, an obesity researcher at Harvard, says the brain sets the number of calories we consume, and it can be easy for people to miss that how much they eat matters less than the fact that their bodies want to hold on to more of those calories. Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, an obesity researcher at Columbia University who has collaborated with Dr. Hall in previous studies, said the body’s systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss. Still, pounds can insidiously creep on. “We eat about 900, 000 to a million calories a year, and burn them all except those annoying 3, 000 to 5, 000 calories that result in an average annual weight gain of about one to two pounds,” he said. “These very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day  —   less than one Starburst candy  —   but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating. ” “It is not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of us experience as we age are the consequences of changes in lifestyle, the environment or just the biology of aging,” Dr. Rosenbaum added. The effects of small imbalances between calories eaten and calories burned are more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight, Dr. Hall said. Yes, there are signals to regain weight, but he wondered how many extra calories people were driven to eat. He found a way to figure that out. He analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug, canagliflozin, that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine, or took a placebo. The drug has no known effect on the brain, and the person does not realize those calories are being spilled. Those taking the drug gradually lost weight. But for every five pounds they lost, they were, without realizing it, eating an additional 200 calories a day. Those extra calories, Dr. Hall said, were a bigger driver of weight regained than the slowing of the metabolism. And, he added, if people fought the urge to eat those calories, they would be hungry. “Unless they continue to fight it constantly, they will regain the weight,” he said. All this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless, experts say. Individuals respond differently to diet manipulations  —     or   diets, for example  —   and to exercise and   drugs, among other interventions. But Dr. Ludwig said that simply cutting calories was not the answer. “There are no doubt exceptional individuals who can ignore primal biological signals and maintain weight loss for the long term by restricting calories,” he said, but he added that “for most people, the combination of incessant hunger and slowing metabolism is a recipe for weight regain  —   explaining why so few individuals can maintain weight loss for more than a few months. ” Dr. Rosenbaum agreed. “The difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower affecting   of the U. S. A. ,” he said. Mr. Cahill knows that now. And with his report from Dr. Hall’s group showing just how much his metabolism had slowed, he stopped blaming himself for his weight gain. “That shame that was on my shoulders went off,” he said.',
        'WASHINGTON  —   Rick Perry, the former Texas governor and   Donald J. Trump’s nominee as energy secretary, said in his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday that he regretted having recommended the abolition of the Energy Department in the past. He addressed his awkward history on the issue up front, telling the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that after “being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy,” he no longer believed, as he said while running for president in 2011, that it should be eliminated. Mr. Perry also offered a   reversal of his views on the science of   climate change, which he called a “contrived, phony mess” in a 2010 book. “I believe the climate is changing,” he said. “I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by   activity. The question is: How do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn’t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy or American jobs?” Mr. Trump, by contrast, has called climate change a “hoax” and has continued to express doubts about established climate science. Mr. Perry also appeared to signal a somewhat different position from Mr. Trump on nuclear weapons policy, the Energy Department’s chief portfolio. Mr. Trump has said the United States must “greatly strengthen and expand” its nuclear capability, “Let it be an arms race,” he said. But Mr. Perry, asked by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, whether he believed expanded testing of nuclear weapons was a “dangerous idea,” replied, “I think anyone would be of the opinion that if we never have to test another nuclear weapon that would be a good thing for the world. ” He added, “I think nonproliferation is a good thing. ” Asked if he would support the Iran nuclear deal  —   which Mr. Trump has derided and which was largely negotiated by the current energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz  —   Mr. Perry said he had not received classified briefings on it. “If D. O. E. has a role to make sure that Iranians are living up to the deal, message delivered, sir,” Mr. Perry said to Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. Last month, when Mr. Trump offered Mr. Perry the job of energy secretary, he accepted with the understanding that the role would be largely focused on promoting American energy development, according to people who have briefed him. Only later did he learn that the agency’s central portfolio is the oversight and management of the nation’s nuclear weapons complex, as well as 17 national scientific laboratories. “This confirmation process has been extremely informative and beneficial for me,” Mr. Perry said, citing his conversations with Mr. Moniz, a nuclear physicist. He highlighted his experience as an Air Force pilot from 1972 to 1977 as among his qualifications to oversee the nuclear weapons complex. Mr. Perry is expected to be easily confirmed by the full Senate. But Democrats pressed him sharply on his views on climate science, noting that the Energy Department is a major science agency, with thousands of research scientists across the country. Democrats expressed concern that his past views, so at odds with established mainstream science, could be a serious impediment. They also pressed him on reports that Mr. Trump’s team is considering making cuts to the Energy Department’s offices of energy efficiency, renewable energy and fossil energy. The last is focused on research to lower   carbon emissions. Mr. Perry said he was unaware of such reports. “Maybe they’ll have the same experience I had and forget that they said that,” he said to laughter, referring to the moment in a 2011 presidential debate when, asked which agencies he wanted to eliminate, he could not recall the name of the Energy Department. What Mr. Perry later called his “oops” moment was widely seen as sinking his campaign. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the panel’s top Democrat, said, “Like many of my colleagues, I am deeply concerned by some of the things that Governor Perry has said in the past about climate science. ” She added: “The Department of Energy’s scientific horsepower is key to understanding these trends. I hope you can understand there is widespread anxiety about   Trump’s intention to dismantle these scientific capabilities or simply just starve them for resources. ” Ms. Cantwell pushed Mr. Perry on whether he would protect the agency’s budget for climate science. “I’m going to protect all the science, whether it’s related to climate and all other aspects of what we are doing,” he replied. Ms. Cantwell also asked Mr. Perry about a questionnaire sent to Energy Department employees by Mr. Trump’s transition team that appeared to target the agency’s climate science research. Mr. Perry disavowed the questionnaire, saying it was sent out before he was selected as the nominee. “I didn’t approve it, I don’t approve it, I didn’t need the information, I don’t want that information,” he said. “That’s not how I manage. ” The hearing was leavened with some humor. Asked by Mr. Franken, who had earlier pushed him sharply on nuclear weapons and climate change in his Senate office, “Did you enjoy meeting me?” Mr. Perry responded, “I hope you are as much fun on the dais as you were on your couch,” before adding, “May I rephrase that, sir?” “Please. Please,” Mr. Franken replied. “Oh, my Lord. Oh, my Lord. ” “Well, I think we’ve found our ‘Saturday Night Live’ sound bite,” Mr. Perry said.',
        'WASHINGTON  —   In the final weeks of the Obama administration, the Justice Department won the first   case involving a transgender victim and sued two cities for blocking mosques from opening. Prosecutors settled   charges with two banks, then sued a third. They filed legal briefs on behalf of New York teenagers being held in solitary confinement, and accused Louisiana of forcing mentally ill patients into nursing homes. And then, with days remaining, prosecutors announced a deal to overhaul Baltimore’s Police Department and accused Chicago of unconstitutional police abuses. The moves capped a historic and sometimes controversial   span in which the Justice Department pushed the frontiers of civil rights laws, inserting itself into private lawsuits and siding with transgender students, juvenile prisoners, the homeless, the blind, and people who videotape police officers. On issues of gay rights, policing, criminal justice, voting and more, government lawyers argued for a broad interpretation of civil rights laws, a view that they consistently said would put them on the right side of history. Few areas of federal policy are likely to change so definitively.   Donald Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, opposes not only the Justice Department’s specific policies on civil rights but its entire approach. While liberal Democrats have criticized Mr. Sessions’s views on specific issues like gay marriage and voting, the larger difference is how differently the Trump administration will view the government’s role in those areas. Vanita Gupta, the head of the civil rights division and the face of the Obama administration’s efforts over the past two years, has spoken about the power “to bend the arc of history itself  —   not merely by serving your clients, but by harnessing the law as a force for positive change. ” “The project of civil rights has always demanded creativity,” she said in an interview. “It requires being bold. Often that means going against the grain of   popular thinking. Or it requires going to the more expansive reading of the law to ensure we are actually ensuring equal protection for everyone. ” Mr. Sessions, a former federal prosecutor, has spoken harshly about lawyers and judges who try to push the law in certain directions  —   “a postmodern philosophy that elevates outcomes over law,” he has called it. Congress makes laws, he has said, and he was outraged when Eric H. Holder Jr. the former attorney general, refused to defend a law banning gay marriage and told his state counterparts that they could ethically do the same regarding state bans. “It was shameful and disgraceful and an abandonment of the rule of law,” Mr. Sessions said in 2015. “I’m not happy about what’s happened to my Department of Justice. ” At this confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions harkened to the era of segregation in arguing that there was no need for the federal government to become involved in prosecuting crimes against women or gay people that were already being prosecuted locally. “I am not sure women or people with different sexual orientations face that kind of discrimination. I just don’t see it,” Mr. Sessions said, denying that he was   or  . The Obama administration saw its mandate much more broadly. One of the clearest examples of this philosophy came last year, when Ms. Gupta wrote a letter to every public school district in the country and told them to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that matched their gender identity. The policy touched off a furious debate and became a touchstone for conservatives who saw the Obama administration as out of touch and making its own laws. Courts have not settled the question of whether the federal   laws apply in matters of gender identity. But Justice Department lawyers, who were fielding questions from school officials, interpreted those protections broadly. Congress created the civil rights division as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, and its mission and leadership have been the subject of frequent debate. President Reagan’s civil rights chief, William Bradford Reynolds, faced criticism from advocacy groups who said he refused to enforce civil rights laws. President Clinton’s choice to lead the division, Bill Lann Lee, served his tenure in an acting capacity after the Senate refused to confirm him, largely over his support for affirmative action. One of Mr. Obama’s nominees, Debo P. Adegbile, was rejected by the Senate over his prior representation of a man convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer. In response, Mr. Obama never nominated Ms. Gupta to the post. Like Mr. Lee, she has served her tenure in an acting capacity. She started work amid unrest in Ferguson, Mo. where angry and sometimes violent demonstrators protested the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager and the way police officers treated African Americans. “History simmers beneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson,” Mr. Holder said at the time as he cast the Justice Department as a voice for those who have felt abused and ignored for years. The Justice Department ultimately cleared the officer involved in the shooting but sued the city, accusing its officers of longstanding abuses of force in encounters with black residents. Ferguson was the most   target of the department’s campaign to use civil rights laws to force changes in police policy. Congress gave the Justice Department that authority in 1994 after the police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, but no administration has used that power nearly as aggressively. The Obama administration has opened two dozen such investigations and sued cities to make policing changes. Police groups have criticized the administration’s approach. James O. Pasco Jr. executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said officers were particularly concerned with the administration’s early talk. Tom Perez, Mr. Obama’s first civil rights chief, declared his division was “once again open for business,” and promised more investigations into police departments. “During his entire tenure there, we were never reached out to once. Not once,” Mr. Pasco said. “He went out of his way to make police officers the villains. ” Mr. Pasco has said collaboration with    officers has since improved and spoke glowingly of Ms. Gupta. But many officers still say the Justice Department has portrayed them unfairly, and Mr. Sessions shares that belief. “These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness,” Mr. Sessions said at his confirmation hearing. He said civil rights lawsuits hurt morale and changed the way citizens viewed the police. “And we need to be careful before we do that. ” In 2015, Mr. Sessions sharply questioned Ms. Gupta about her views on policing and her A. C. L. U. advocacy. “You come from a background that indicates an aggressiveness in these areas,” he said. Ms. Gupta said such questions reflect a double standard. “I don’t think the same comment gets made of criminal prosecutors who’ve obtained a lot of convictions,” she said in an interview, “that they’re too aggressive to do their jobs effectively. ” She added, “I was an aggressive civil rights chief, and I’m proud of that. ” Ms. Gupta will leave government with the administration but a team of career lawyers remains. Many view Mr. Sessions’ nomination warily, but senior officials have urged an open mind. Ms. Gupta said she hopes her successor will have one, too. “This is not abstract work done for its own sake,” she said. “It is fundamentally about the people whose rights we protect. ”',
        'Updated: 11:50 p. m. The New York Times is driving to Friday’s inauguration with supporters of   Donald J. Trump. On Wednesday, we traveled with a woman from Massachusetts, the bluest state east of the Mississippi. On Thursday, we joined a man from West Virginia, the reddest state in the East. Dianna Ploss, 53, is a volunteer organizer for Mr. Trump, a turn of fate that surprised even her  —   a longtime Democrat who until recently was uninterested in politics. I am a national correspondent for The Times, originally from Granville, Mass. and I rode with a photographer in the back seat of a Dodge pickup driven by Dianna’s friend Scott Hayes, a landscaper. There was a cardboard cutout of Mr. Trump, too. Along the way, we talked about life, Mr. Trump and the future of America. We stopped at a McDonald’s, Cracker Barrel, Applebee’s and multiple rest areas. We listened to Abba, the Supremes, Fleetwood Mac, Cheryl Lynn and Obama. I got carsick. And   hours later, we made it to Washington. SABRINA TAVERNISE _____ GLOUCESTER, Mass. 10:27 a. m.: I just wrapped up a Facebook Live video introduction to Dianna and Scott, and we’re about to leave for the drive. For her part, Dianna spent the past year working tirelessly for Mr. Trump’s campaign, spending her own money and countless hours to get him elected. She was even a delegate at the Republican convention. She also lived for years in Cambridge, where Hillary Clinton won 88 percent of the vote. (Mr. Trump got 6 percent.) She has a rare ability to move back and forth between the two worlds. She has a lot to say about both. She had never really been that interested in politics. She grew up in Boston in the 1970s. Her dad worked as a school bus driver. Her mom raised four children and tended bar. “We were all Democrats back then,” she says. “Forty years later, we are all Republicans. ” Miles driven: 0. Miles to go: 470. _____ NEAR WORCESTER, Mass. 11:59 a. m.: It has started to snow. The truck’s windows are steaming up. Dianna is talking to people on the phone, trying to help them find a place to stay in Washington. The Airbnb she will be staying in there is filling up fast. Her phone is pinging with people talking to her on Facebook. It’s like a giant extended family all chattering at once. Her journey to this point has been quite a trip of its own. Dianna’s adult life happened suddenly and soon. She got pregnant as a freshman in high school  —   a Catholic school. She was afraid. She says she got through it by putting each part of her life in a different room and closing the door. At graduation, she was the student council president. She thought she should go to college, but now she had a daughter. She had an underachiever boyfriend. She had no money. And her family did not understand what college would get her. It took her 10 years to finish community college. She worked in a bank, painting houses, as a secretary in an   shop. In her   she decided to go to nursing school. She worked in cardiac surgery, in psychiatry, in urgent care. She did well, but she didn’t like it. What she really liked was volunteering. And organizing. She knew nothing about running, but became the director of a private track club, managing 25 coaches and 200 kids ages 8 to 14, and raising the money to support it. When she had the kids sell a coupon book with discounts from local businesses, it was the     the club had ever run. Miles driven: 71. Miles to go: 399. _____ CHARLTON, Mass. 12:26 p. m.: I am carsick. Scott spots a rest area and pulls in. Dianna buys me a Coke and even finds me generic   medicine in a store. “Here you go, honey,” she says kindly. “Sit down. You don’t look so good. ” I’m drinking a full sugar Coke, and my stomach is already starting to feel better. Miles driven: 83. Miles to go: 387. _____ STURBRIDGE, Mass. 12:47 p. m.: “Oh my God! You got to put this one in!” Dianna says, looking through a stack of CDs. “The Partridge Family?! Are you nuts?” says Scott. “I have Abba,” she says. “Neil Diamond. Chicago. Bee Gees. But I love the Partridge Family. ” Scott: “Oh boy. ” The music begins to play. “I woke up in love this morning. Went to sleep with you on my mind. ” “It’s a very complicated song,” she says, laughing. Miles driven: 92. Miles to go: 378. _____ NEAR HARTFORD, 1:07 p. m.: Dianna reads through some of the comments on the Facebook Live segment: Lots of angry shouting about Trump. Some of it about us. I ask Dianna how she feels. “Uncomfortable,” she says. As much as she is part of the Trump team, she tries to avoid alienating people. Maybe that comes from having lived in Cambridge. Maybe that comes from her personality as a networker. “I try to encourage people not to yell,” she says. “I had a little meeting with women who are part of the volunteer team. I said, ‘If our goal is getting people to go toward Trump, criticizing them isn’t the right way. It makes you look bad, too.’ ” “I don’t attack people personally,” she adds. “Except if I’m by myself and the TV is on. ” She pops an Abba album into the truck’s CD player. Miles driven: 126. Miles to go: 344. _____ WETHERSFIELD, Conn. 1:30 p. m.: I ask Dianna how someone who grew up a Democrat in Massachusetts could have wound up a Trump voter. Her move toward politics, she explains, was less a burning ideological expression and more an affinity for people, and for bringing them together. She was good at leading people, but the world was also changing. In 2015, she sold her house in Cambridge and quit nursing to focus on an invention that involves beverages. “I was living in my camper in Framingham in my friend’s yard,” she says. “They were liberal. Stuff was happening  —   San Bernardino, Paris. I’d think: I don’t know if I agree with them. ” When Mr. Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, she felt no sudden spark, she says. But his message steadily seeped in, like a   realization about herself and her beliefs: one she had always had, but had never really considered. “People were lying down everywhere,” she says, recalling protests about police violence. “They were lying down in Harvard Square. They were lying down on Route 93. They blocked traffic for three hours.   is a really congested road you want to pull your hair out anyway. To shut it down? What the hell is going on? What are these people doing?” At some point, she registered as a Republican. “I was trying to find out who I am in this whole crazy mess,” she says. “I feel like I had to take a stand. It was just crazy. I couldn’t understand it. ” Miles driven: 135. Miles to go: 335. _____ BERLIN, Conn. 1:37 p. m.: It has stopped raining. I ask Dianna how she came to like Mr. Trump. She says she did not take his candidacy seriously at first. “All I knew about him was that reality show,” she says. But when she tuned in, she realized he appealed to her. “I really liked Trump’s   thing. I grew up, I went to Catholic school. We did the Pledge of Allegiance every day. That was important. ” “I started to pay attention not to what he was saying, but to the effect that he had. The freedom of speech things. He said outrageous things but so what. People would get so worked up over outrageous things. ” “He was the tough guy. I like that he stood up for himself. He didn’t take any garbage from people. He retaught people how to have their  . He showed that you can stand up for yourself. ” Miles driven: 142. Miles to go: 328. _____ NORWALK, Conn. 2:53 p. m.: “Oh, they were not happy in there,” Dianna announces, emerging from a McDonald’s with Scott, the Trump cutout and a small bag of French fries. (I had been in the bathroom and missed the action.) “The guy behind the counter said, ‘We don’t do politics,’” Dianna reports. “I told him we just needed some fries. ” A woman in a puffy blue jacket sitting at the window bangs on the glass with her fist. Having caught our attention, she points her finger at the cardboard Trump and gives a deep   motion. We are standing in the parking lot, and two women walk briskly up to Dianna. “I love Mr. Trump, trust me,” says Lillia Millard, a retired translator who was born in Russia and now lives in West Norwalk. “He says it like it is, just like me. ” Dianna asks if she is going to watch the inauguration. “Yes!” she says enthusiastically. Her daughter, a journalist, will not. “She’s going to the women’s march, unfortunately,” Ms. Millard says, adding, “I still have until Saturday to talk her out of it. ” Scott gives her a   bumper sticker, and we pull back out onto the highway to the music of Grand Funk Railroad. Miles driven: 202. Miles to go: 268. _____ DARIEN, Conn. 3:26 p. m.: We are stopping again. The rest stop is all beige plastic and fake wood. A television is playing President Obama’s last news conference. It is barely audible under a thumping Stevie Nicks song. It is in the final minutes. “There are a lot more good people than bad in this country,” he says. Dianna says back: “Yeah. I agree with that. I do. ” He says that he curses more behind closed doors. “So do I,” Dianna says. He is talking about his daughters. He keeps going. He says he believes in this country. Dianna stops agreeing. “Do you believe he believes in this country?” I ask her. “No,” she replies. “I don’t believe that. ” I ask her why. “For all these years, people said all this stuff about him and I didn’t believe them,” she said. “But he has done so much to harm America. He basically tried to be Robin Hood. His trade policies. His willingness to try to take away from people who had more and give to those who had less. ” “The middle class shrunk, more people ended up at the bottom. That was as the result of him. Obamacare was a big part of this. Look how much money it costs me just for my health care. It didn’t make sense to me. It’s hard to know. Is it really what’s in his heart, or are his ideals getting in his way?” Miles driven: 207. Miles to go: 263. _____ Still in DARIEN, Conn. 4:33 p. m.: We’re eating spicy hummus and carrots at the Darien, Conn. rest stop. I am asking Dianna about Mr. Obama. She didn’t vote for him. But she defended him when her family or friends would attack him. Now, she is glad to see him go. Part of that is because of policing. “The first thing he said that struck me was when he said the Cambridge police acted stupidly,” she said, referring to Mr. Obama’s remark about the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. a black Harvard professor, in 2009 as Mr. Gates tried to enter his own home. “When that comment came out, something in my head went, ‘Huh? ’” “Then he said, ‘Trayvon Martin could have been my son.’ Maybe that’s what he’s thinking, but when he says something like that as a leader, people listen. I had this like, ‘What?’ I was confused by that. What are you doing?” She added: “Things have changed in terms of the criminality. People will do anything. They are going up to cops and executing them. People are blowing themselves up. They are ramming trucks into things. If you alienate the police, then we are going to have no law and order. ” On Mr. Obama, she said: “When you are the leader, there are times when you have to bite your tongue. ” She added: “I feel the irony in that, because people will say Donald Trump doesn’t bite his tongue. I want to see how it plays out once he’s president. I don’t know the answer. ” Miles driven: 207. Miles to go: 263. _____ FORT LEE, N. J. 6 p. m.: We are back on   closer now to the end of our trip than to the beginning. The Supremes are playing our driver, Scott, is grateful that we are no longer listening to Abba. We have just crossed over the George Washington Bridge. I’m asking Dianna and Scott about immigration. For Scott, economics undergirds his thinking. Two friends used to give him a lot of landscaping work 10 or 15 years ago, but have since stopped they have Latin American employees now. Another client, who recently sold a company for millions, said he wanted to cut Scott’s rate to $20 an hour from $30 and asked him if he could learn Spanish to manage a work crew. “Fundamentally, it’s not fair,” he says. “I’m working seven days a week now so I can carry myself through the winter. They say Republicans want the cheaper labor and Democrats want the votes. But I think they both want cheaper labor. People with money just want cheaper labor. ” He says he does not blame the laborers, but is angry with politicians who talk as if it were not a problem. “If I was a poor person south of the border, I’d probably do the same thing,” he says. Scott, 58, who lives in Beverly, Mass. has led rafting trips in Texas on the Rio Grande for years. In 2010, he says, he was at the end of a rafting trip when he saw five people trying to cross the river. They appeared to be asking him to help them across. He kept going. Several months later, Janet Napolitano  —   then the secretary of homeland security  —   was nearby, in Laredo, Tex. and said the border had never been more secure. Scott says he did not believe her. “You lose your language, border and your culture, you’re going to lose your country,” he says, sounding one of the  ’s campaign themes. “Your country is done. ” Miles driven: 240. Miles to go: 230. _____ EAST WINDSOR, N. J. 6:57 p. m.: The car is silent. Dianna: “Do you like lobster?” Scott: “I like it, but it’s expensive. ” Dianna: “I just don’t like fighting with my food. ” Scott: “The only thing that’s really good is the tail. ” Dianna: “The only thing that’s really good is the butter. Anything tastes good dipped in butter. ” Miles driven: 296. Miles to go: 174. _____ MOUNT HOLLY, N. J. 7:38 p. m.  We pulled into a Cracker Barrel for dinner. Dianna had never been inside one. “O. K. there’s country music in the bathroom,” she said. “It smells nice  —   like candles or something. ” She surveys the store. She looks at a wall full of coffee mugs with names on them: Grandpa. Papa. Mom. “Look at all these cups. It’s spewing happiness. It’s like a quaint little town or something. ” We left because there was no table with an outlet near it for Dianna or me. Miles driven: 318. Miles to go: 152. _____ WESTAMPTON, N. J. 8:11 p. m.: We are waiting for dinner in an Applebee’s. I ask Dianna and Scott what they expect from Mr. Trump and if they are afraid he might disappoint them. “If he doesn’t deliver on the economy, I’ll be disappointed,” Scott says. “He says he’s going to change the tax rate for the middle class. That’s huge for me. I bought a house five years ago and the taxes have gone up $200 every single year. ” Scott doesn’t trusts the elites  —   entrenched politicians with money. “I don’t trust McCain, I don’t trust Rubio, I don’t trust Paul Ryan,” he says. “I love Trump for calling out the elites and the ruling class for who they are. Because they have forgotten about the working man and working woman. ” He is also suspicious of the term “comprehensive immigration reform. ” Dianna says: “Anytime a politician uses the word comprehensive, it makes you think they are lying. It’s just an empty word. Smoke and mirrors. They throw big words around, make it look like they are actually doing something. Makes people feel like, almost like they are not smart enough to understand what they are doing. ” She added, “I think Trump will deliver. ” Our dinner comes. Two shrimp salads and a burger. Miles driven: 319. Miles to go: 151. _____ NEW CASTLE, Del. 9:51 p. m.: We are getting sleepy. Another toll, this one for the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Scott thinks the sign says $400. “What! ?” Dianna says in mock shock. “Got to pay for that wall somehow. ” Everybody laughs. We pull up to the cash lane. An older woman in a wool hat, glasses and a yellow security vest hands us change. Holding up the Trump cardboard cutout, Dianna asks: “Do you know who this is?” The woman responds in a deadpan voice: “I’ve never seen him in my life. ” But when she is asked if she likes him, a smile creeps onto her face. “Thumbs up,” she says. Miles driven: 366. Miles to go: 104. _____ NEWARK, Del. 10:03 p. m.: It’s dark. Dinner’s over. Disco is playing: Cheryl Lynn’s “Got To Be Real. ” Dianna is driving to give Scott a rest. Cardboard Trump is still smirking in the back seat. “I’m getting out my bell bottoms,” says Scott drily. I sing for a while. Dianna does too. Then I ask about health care. “I spent probably $20, 000 on health care last year,” Dianna says. She was paying about $850 a month through a private plan she bought herself. But her deductible for    care jumped to $4, 500 from $3, 000.   she says, jumped to $3, 000 from $2, 000. Dianna, who has been living off the proceeds from the sale of her house in Cambridge, says she could have gotten insured through Obamacare last year, because she was not working. But she chose not to. “I said, Dianna, how can you go on food stamps and get free health care if you are volunteering for Trump? I thought it would be the wrong thing to do. ” But now she has Obamacare. She is helping to support her father, she explains, and her budget has gotten tight. “I don’t feel good that I had to do that,” she says. “I have more control over my life when I have better health insurance. It’s also about pride. ” Miles driven: 381. Miles to go: 89. _____ BALTIMORE, 10:50 p. m.: Hurtling through Maryland. Fleetwood Mac’s greatest hits playing, “Rhiannon” among them. Whatever happens with Mr. Trump, Scott Hayes has already won something important: a deep network of people who think like him. He has a flip phone. He is not on Facebook. But he believes he will hold on to those new connections. They have revived him. Made him feel more alive. “I always felt so alone, like nobody wanted to hear what I was saying,” he says. “So I’d go to these rallies just to see if there were other people who thought like I did. Now I’m meeting all kinds of people. It’s been awesome. ” Dianna wants to keep up the momentum with all the people she has met, too. Like the woman named May who owns a Chinese restaurant in Newton, Mass. and who went up to New Hampshire on Tuesdays with some of her staff to volunteer. Dianna organized a Christmas party for Trump supporters in Massachusetts in December. There was Champagne on every table. The cardboard cutout of Trump was there, too. “I’m relieved,” she says. “He won. I think he’s going to deliver. ” Miles driven: 427. Miles to go: 43. _____ WASHINGTON, 11:50 p. m.: We pull into the parking garage at Dianna’s Airbnb in southwest Washington, ride the elevator to the eighth floor, and walk into a spacious   with parquet floors. Scott holds cardboard Trump. There is a view of the Washington Monument. “Wow, it’s huge,” Dianna says, looking out a long glass sliding door. “This is, like, pretty fancy. ” Scott stands the   up. I ask the two of them how it feels to be at the end of this    journey. “It’s the end, but it’s the beginning,” Dianna says. “Now, it’s a new chapter in our lives, for the country, for Mr. Trump. Let’s see what he can do. ” Miles driven: 470. Miles to go: 0.'
